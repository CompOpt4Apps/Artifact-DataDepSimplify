/*
 * The presburger interface is divided into the following parts.
 * These parts are all included together, but are in separate
 * files to keep things organized a bit.
 *
 * In many files, you can include just some of the following,
 * specifically: if you are building a presburger tree, just
 * include "pres_tree.h"; if you are querying it, include
 * "pres_dnf.d" and "pres_conj.h"; if you are doing relational
 * operations, include "Relation.h"
 *
 * Most of the function definitions are in the .c files with
 * the same name as the .h that declares them, except:
 *   the remap and push_exists functions are in pres_var.c
 *   the DNFize functions are in pres_dnf.c
 *   the functions involving printing are in pres_print.c
 *   the beautify functions are in pres_beaut.c
 *   the rearrange functions are in pres_rear.c
 *   the compression functions are in pres_cmpr.c
