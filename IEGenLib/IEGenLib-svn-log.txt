Based on email Mahesh sent, I checked the Python bindings in the nightly build. The issue was bigger than just a fix to the README to indicate usage 
of ./configure --build-python. The Python bindings were broken because 
we had started using isl with sets and relations for normalization.
Had to put some of the new header files and remove old header file 
from iegenlib.i.
Had to change build of shared library so that was being linked with 
isl and other libraries. See CMakeLists.txt in src/bindings/.
Had to update example in README to use appendCurrEnv correctly. i
It gave me a segmentation fault. Had to break parameters down. Fix is in README.

IEGRTWO-87, this is an in between commit.  I fixed the segfaults
with normalize based on Barbara's email.  Lots of debug output is still in
there.  Fixing the issues caused a problem in compose in that some substitution
that should be happening isn't, so I need to fix that.  Compose is a
bit fragile because it does substitution in order.  Should refactor that.
normalize is still in progress, but now Barbara could incorporate
ISL part.

Finishing IEGRONE-86.  Constraints are now ordered in alphabetic order
by their toString.
Ran into some other bugs along the way:
    - The problem with the operator== is that the Set copy constructor 
    was also calling the copy constructor for the super class, so it 
    was being called twice.
    - Set::Set(std::string str) does not need to call cleanUp because 
    the assignment operator does.
    - string compare does not necessarily return a 1 or a -1. Just 
    a positive or negative value if the strings aren't equal.  Was affecting
    sort of constraints.

I have marked most of the function with a param tag that states if it adopts the object being passed in or not.

I have fixed all but one of the memory errors from valgrind.
The last error should be fixed by Brenden.

in a relation.

variables that have not yet been identified as tuple variables.

Created almost empty new_set_relation files.  Everything builds and the regression
tests run.  We do get a warning when building the iegenlib library that 
new_set_relation doesn't have anything in it.

Modified CMakeLists to use doc as a subdirectory in order to create the 
doxygen build target. Had to add this target to Makefile too; related is
creating doc/CMakeLists.txt, which is also being checked in.

Merging cmake changes to the trunk - took the building of iegenlib and
the parser out of the src CMakeLists and put them into the src/iegenlib
CMakeLists. Also added comments to top level CMakeLists regarding Makefile

Removed IneqExp and EqExp because we're not going to use a Visitor
design pattern on these things.  Also improved toString() output
in cases where a term other than the first has a negative coefficient
(now prints it as simple subtraction).
